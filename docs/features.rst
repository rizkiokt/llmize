Features
=========

LLMize is a powerful Python package that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for numerical optimization tasks. Here's a comprehensive overview of its features:

Core Optimization Features
---------------------------

LLM-Based Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LLMize implements state-of-the-art LLM-based optimization techniques, drawing inspiration from the OPRO (Optimization by PROmpting) methodology (`paper here <https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409>`_). The framework supports both maximization and minimization objectives, handling both continuous and discrete optimization problems. It provides multiple optimization strategies including OPRO, ADOPRO (beta), HLMEA (beta), and HLMSA (beta), allowing users to choose the most appropriate approach for their specific optimization needs.

Flexible Problem Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The framework offers versatile problem definition capabilities, supporting both text-based problem descriptions and Python function-based objective definitions. It includes robust constraint handling through penalty functions and supports both single and multi-objective optimization scenarios. Users can customize problem representations to match their specific requirements, making it adaptable to a wide range of optimization challenges.

Advanced Optimization Features
-------------------------------

Parallel Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LLMize features built-in parallel processing capabilities for efficient solution evaluation. The framework supports multi-threaded optimization, enabling efficient batch processing of solutions. It's designed to scale effectively with problem size while maintaining resource awareness, ensuring optimal performance across different hardware configurations.

Callback System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The framework includes an extensible callback system for monitoring and controlling the optimization process. It provides several built-in callbacks for early stopping, temperature adaptation, and optimal score monitoring, along with support for custom progress tracking. This system enables real-time optimization monitoring and allows users to develop custom callbacks for specialized requirements.

Optimization Control
--------------------

Early Stopping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LLMize implements a sophisticated early stopping mechanism with configurable criteria. It supports multiple stopping conditions including score improvement thresholds, maximum iterations, and optimal score achievement. This feature helps prevent overfitting and unnecessary computation, making the optimization process more efficient.

Adaptive Temperature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The framework includes dynamic temperature adjustment capabilities for the LLM. It automatically scales the temperature based on optimization progress, solution diversity, and convergence metrics. Users can configure temperature bounds and implement custom temperature adaptation strategies to fine-tune the optimization process.

Results and Analysis
--------------------

Comprehensive Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LLMize provides detailed optimization results including best solutions and scores, complete solution history, and convergence metrics. The framework also tracks optimization statistics and performance indicators, giving users insights into the optimization process and its outcomes.

Visualization Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The package includes built-in visualization capabilities for analyzing optimization results. Users can visualize solution trajectories, perform convergence analysis, and plot performance metrics. The framework also supports custom visualization implementations for specialized analysis needs.

Integration and Extensibility
-----------------------------

API Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LLMize offers a clean and intuitive API that supports multiple LLM providers, including Google, OpenAI, and Huggingface inference API. It's designed for easy integration with existing workflows and includes documentation with type hints for better IDE support. The API is structured to be user-friendly.

Extensibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The framework features a modular architecture that supports custom optimization strategies and plugin systems for new features. It's designed to encourage community contributions while maintaining version compatibility. This extensibility allows users to adapt the framework to their specific needs.

Performance and Scalability
----------------------------

Efficient Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LLMize is optimized for performance with memory-efficient processing and scalable architecture. It's designed to handle large problems efficiently while optimizing resource utilization. The framework includes parallel processing support for improved performance on multi-core systems.

Cross-Platform Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The framework is designed for platform-independent operation, supporting cloud deployment and containerization. It's compatible with multiple operating systems and offers flexible environment configuration options, making it suitable for various deployment scenarios.
