Features
========

LLMize comes with a comprehensive set of features for LLM-based optimization:

LLM-Based Optimization
---------------------

Utilizes LLM for iteratively generating and optimizing solutions, inspired by OPRO methods `[paper here] <https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409>`_.

Flexible Problem Definition
--------------------------

Supports both text-based problem descriptions and objective functions.

Parallel Processing
-----------------

Built-in support for parallel evaluation of solutions.

Callback System
--------------

Extensible callback mechanism for monitoring and controlling the optimization process.

Early Stopping
-------------

Built-in early stopping mechanism to prevent overfitting.

Adaptive Temperature
-------------------

Dynamic LLM temperature adjustment based on optimization progress.

Comprehensive Results
-------------------

Detailed optimization results including:
- Best scores
- Solution history
- Convergence metrics
