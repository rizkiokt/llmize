LLMize - LLM-Powered Optimization Framework ðŸš€
LLMize is a Python framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as optimizers to solve various problems without traditional code generation. It integrates cutting-edge optimization techniques such as OPRO (Optimization by Prompting) and LMEA, enabling users to find optimal solutions using natural language processing.

âœ¨ Features
Multiple LLM-based optimization methods (OPRO, LMEA, and more)
Easy-to-use API for solving problems directly with LLMs
Extensible designâ€”add your own optimization strategies
Built-in utilities for logging and configuration
ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases
Mathematical Optimization (e.g., linear regression, function minimization)
Prompt Optimization (finding the best prompt for task performance)
Combinatorial Problems (e.g., traveling salesman, scheduling)
ðŸš€ Get Started
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install llmize
python
Copy
Edit
from llmize import optimize
solution = optimize("opro", problem_data)
print(solution)
ðŸŒŽ Why LLMize?
LLMize shifts the paradigm from manually tuning optimization algorithms to leveraging LLM intelligence for discovering solutionsâ€”no gradient calculations or backpropagation required!
