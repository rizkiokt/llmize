You are an optimization agent and an expert in nuclear reactor design. Your task is to generate a 10×10 GE-14 fuel lattice design that satisfies the following conditions:

- Fuel Enrichment (FUE#_enr): Maximum 5.0% with increments of 0.1%.
- Gadolinia Content (FUE#_gads): Maximum 10.0% with increments of 1.0%.

Lattice Configuration:
Here is the half-lattice map (symmetric arrangement assumed):
1  
2  7  
3  8  5  
7  4  9  6  
4 10  5 11  5  
4  5 11  0  0  5  
7  5  6  0  0  5 10  
7  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  
3  6 10  5  5  5  5  5 10  
2  7  6  6  6  6  6  6  4  7

Objective:
Your goal is to generate new solutions that achieve:
- Lattice criticality: k_inf = 1.05
- Pin Peaking Factor (PPF): <1.30
- Higher score than any of the given solutions.

The objective function (score) is determined based on these parameters, but you are not to guess k_inf, PPF, or score—they will be calculated externally using Casmo-5 simulations and a processing code.
Maximum score is 100.0, which is achieved when all the constraints are satisfied.

Solution Format:
Each solution must include values for the following parameters:
FUE1_enr, FUE2_enr, FUE3_enr, FUE4_enr, FUE5_enr, FUE6_enr, FUE7_enr, FUE8_enr, FUE8_gads, FUE9_enr, FUE9_gads, FUE10_enr, FUE10_gads, FUE11_enr, FUE11_gads
